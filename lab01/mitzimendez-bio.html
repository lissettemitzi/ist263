<body>
    I am an Information Management and Technology major, with a minor in Finance interested in the field of Project Management. 
    I am involved in many organizations on campus, like being an admission ambassador, being involved in the Syracuse Marketing Committee, and other student organizations.
    Something that I like to do during my free time is go on runs and hanging out with my friends. 
    My favorite TV shows include One Tree Hill, and Gossip Girl. I am the oldest of 3 siblings and enjoy being a role model for my siblings. 
    I look forward to making an impact on the technology industry with the experience and connections I gain during my time at Syracuse University.
