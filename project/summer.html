    <p> “This is the song of the Summer” is a phrase that many of us have heard yearly on the radio. But what makes a song, “the song of the Summer?”</p>
    <p>There are certain songs that people hear and immediately get brought back to the season of warmth and sunshine. The tempo of a summer song usually must be “upbeat but chill according to Sarah Brindell, a songwriting professor at the Berklee College of Music. For many people, a summer song has to be one that they are able to relate to. For artists, this is something that they use to their advantage because things such as going out and feeling the sunshine is something anyone can do.</p>
    <p>Another key element that is used in summer songs is the fact that lyrics are usually “nostalgic or anticipatory.” Artists do this by picking lyrics carefully and making sure that they give of a sense of celebration.</p>
    <p>Out of my top 5 most listened to songs for 2023, the song that would fall under the category of a “Summer” song would be All You’rn by Tyler Childers. </p>
